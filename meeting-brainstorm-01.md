**[07:40]** "So can we just, like, can we just lay out, like, decisions? So there's a few things I've said there which I'm like, yeah, we're doing this. Can we lay those out and put them to rest? And I'll just confirm that I'll put them to rest, that you just laid them out. And then there's just a few questions that you should be able to hear that I'm a bit unsure about. Can you just name, give them a number, and we'll go through those and just make some decisions."

**[00:23]** "So I was hoping you would sort of separate them into the things I was sure about and decisions I still had to make, but that's fine, I can do that. So the decisions was like this. So another thing to add to that is definitely the introduction, which is like the body scan, deep breathing kind of thing. So maybe add that on top of those decisions."

**[07:28]** "So more so, sorry for the third one, just to clarify, it's not the one big thing. The main difference is in options one and two there are long breaks of silences, whereas in option three I was envisioning more so just still sort of like the cadence of option number, I think it was the cadence of option number two with like ingest, digest, ingest, digest, ingest, digest, just with less sort of silence. So just sort of things like, hey, keep paying attention, hey, are you listening, you know, in between the things and in my head the best way to do that is just have, so you listen to your like three sentences or paragraph or two paragraphs, you start listening really well at the beginning, then you sort of start to daydream and then it just switches to a different voice and goes, now bring your attention, like it's just, you know, it's like a focused meditation basically, but instead of focusing on the breathing, you're focusing on the reading. And it's saying like, your attention might have drifted, just relax and notice that it drifted and go back to the book. Like that's what I'm thinking for the third one. And there's just, instead of there being silence for you to think, it's like there's book for you to listen to and you try to just keep your focused attention on that. So could you sort of clarify that?"
